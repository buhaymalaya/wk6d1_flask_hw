By now we should have a working Database integrated with our Flask app.  
Specifically, we should have working models and their corresponding tables.  
The goal for tonight's assignment is to make sure all routes related to CRUD operations are 
incorporating/using the DB!  If you were able to tackle this for the weekend assignment 
please make sure all are integrated correctly and you're good to go.  
Incorporate nested schema for an extra challenge!
